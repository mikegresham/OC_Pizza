# P6 OC Pizza

Context

"OC Pizza" is a young and expanding group that specializes in pizza delivery and take-out. It already has five stores and plans to open at least three more by the end of the year. One of the group’s managers has contacted you in order to set up an information technology measuring system, launched in all of the pizzerias to accomplish the following:
To be more efficient in the handling of orders- from the receipt to the delivery and throughout the preparation process;
To follow the orders placed and their preparation in real time;
To follow the stock of remaining ingredients to know which pizzas are still available
To propose a memory aid to the pizzaiolos, indicating the recipe of each pizza
To inform or notify customers about the status of their order
And to allow customers to:
Place orders, in addition to ordering by phone or on the website
Pay for their order online if they would like, otherwise they will pay directly to the delivery person
Modify or cancel an order until it has been completely prepared
The customer has already done a small inspection and has found that the existing software cannot handle these tasks.
